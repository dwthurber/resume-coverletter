Together, they tell your professional story &ndash; the goals you want to help an employer achieve, and the skills, experience, and values you possess that will help you do so.</p><p>As you craft your cover letters and resume, please keep the following, general tips in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>The resume and cover letter must be complementary, but each must also be strong enough to stand on its own.</strong>&nbsp;You never know which document recruiters and hiring managers will scan first.</li><li><strong>Cover letters aren't optional. </strong>They are essential for connecting your strengths to the job's requirements, and it's advisable to write one for each application, even if it isn't requested.</li><li><strong>Well-written resumes and cover letters are only helpful if they're seen by the right people.</strong> A good rule of thumb is to spend at least as much time networking as you do submitting applications. Many would argue you should spend more.</li><li><strong>Asking for help is not a weakness.</strong> If you have questions about how to design your job search strategy, please contact Audra Nelson, Kristin McCann, or Lois Trautvetter. We&rsquo;re here to help!</li></ul><p>With that said, please take advantage of these training tools to help you craft cover letters and a resume that will instill you with pride, impress employers, and generate interviews.

        <div class="container editable"><h4>Creating a Strong Higher Ed Resume</h4><p>Resumes are marketing documents, which means that, to be effective, they need to resonate with your desired audience. To find out what will speak to your target higher education employer, review job descriptions in your area of career interest prior to writing your resume.</p><p><strong>Activity: Keep an Ongoing, Comprehensive Resume<br />When to start: Upon enrolling in the MSHE program</strong></p><p>You probably wrote a resume when you applied to the MSHE program. Don&rsquo;t delete it! A comprehensive, all-encompassing resume is a great thing to have on hand.</p><ol><li>As you complete class projects, internships, and job projects, add them to your comprehensive resume.</li><li>Do a search on higheredjobs.com, and identify a few jobs of interest to you. Scan the requirements and the verbs used in the job descriptions.</li><li>How many of the requirements and verbs in your desired job descriptions are incorporated into your resume? Are there skills you need to grow during your time as a graduate student in order to make yourself more competitive for these positions? Now is the time to do so!</li></ol><p><strong>Activity: Write a <i>Targeted</i> Resume<br />When to start: When you begin actively searching for a job (i.e. three to six months prior to graduation)</strong></p><p>While the comprehensive resume is good to keep in your files, the resume you distribute should be targeted to your specific career goal. This activity will help you write a more targeted resume.</p><ol><li>Do a search on higheredjobs.com, and identify a few jobs of interest to you.</li><li>Highlight action verbs used in the position description and in the required and preferred qualifications.</li><li>Circle any repeated verbs.</li><li>Make a list of field-specific terminology or jargon included in the description.</li><li>Now, take a look at your resume. Have you used the verbs you highlighted and circled in your lists of duties and achievements? If not, how can you re-write the bullets to incorporate these skills?</li><li>What details have you included in your resume that now seem extraneous or distracting, given the requirements and needs of the positions you&rsquo;re seeking? Remember that an employer may spend only 30 seconds to a minute scanning your resume. Make sure all the details you include are either relevant to his/her needs and the requirements of the position or important for conveying your unique qualities as a person and professional.</li></ol><div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div><h4>Sample Resume</h4><p>Explore the sample resume below and think critically about what makes this resume good or bad.

A physical address can benefit you, especially if you live in the city in which you&rsquo;re job searching, by sparking fewer questions/reservations in an employer&rsquo;s mind. If you&rsquo;re worried about security and you&rsquo;re posting your resume to online job boards, though, a physical address isn&rsquo;t always necessary anymore. If you choose not to list your address, be sure to include your telephone number, email address, and perhaps a LinkedIn URL.</p><h3>What else can be listed in the heading?</h3><p>Some applicants list their MBTI type or their five StrengthsQuest strengths. These are particularly relevant if you&rsquo;re applying to positions within student affairs and you know, based on networking or informational interviews, that this information is important to your potential employer. Otherwise, it is fine to stick with just the basic contact information.</p></div></div><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o resume-two"></i><div class="info-menu resume-two"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a><h2>Education: Publicizing Your Degrees</h2><h3>Which should I list first - education or experience?</h3><p>Unless you are a career advancer with several years of relevant experience, andyour MSHE degree is simply an added bonus, &ldquo;Education&rdquo; should probably be the first section of your resume. You&rsquo;ve invested time and money in this degree; it&rsquo;s important to market it!</p><h3>How should I write MSHE?</h3><p>Write out the full name and include the university, city, and state. Also include your graduation month and year even if it is anticipated graduation for the future. For example:</p><blockquote><strong>Northwestern University</strong> | Evanston, IL<br />Master of Science in Higher Education Administration &amp; Policy, Graduation Month Year</blockquote><h3>Should I include anything else?</h3><p>Master&rsquo;s Project: Title or, if title isn&rsquo;t relevant to job target, use a description of the project, written with your desired audience in mind</p><p>Relevant courses: List only if particularly relevant to target position and only if you&rsquo;re willing to talk about them in an interview</p><p>GPA: Typically, GPA is unnecessary at this point in your career. If you choose to include it, do so for both undergrad and grad school so that you don&rsquo;t raise a question in the employer&rsquo;s mind by including it in only one place.</p><p>Honors: Feel free to list honors.

To ensure that all your relevant experiences are seen first, you may choose to group experiences under two headings &ndash; Higher Education Experience and Additional Experience. If you have enough experience in your targeted career area, you can make your heading even more specific (e.g., Career Services Experience, International Education Experience, or Enrollment Management Experience may precede Additional Experience).</p></div></div><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o resume-four"></i><div class="info-menu resume-four"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a><h2>Bulleted Descriptions: Proving Your Abilities and Achievements</h2><h3>How do I write compelling bullet points?</h3><ul><li>Start with powerful, action verbs.

            <div class="editable"><p>Cover letters are a way to stand out from the pile. A writing sample and marketing tool, the cover letter shows that you understand the needs of the open position and convinces an employer you can fulfill those needs with your particular skill set and experience.</p><p>Cover letters should be three to five paragraphs in length and no longer than one page. Be sure to use a business letter format, as indicated in the sample, and know that the more you can tailor letters to each specific position for which you apply, the better.</p><p>Hiring managers expect to see specific experience in your cover letter related to the job description. To accomplish this, you might want to start by going through a job description and looking for the key areas you can highlight (literally highlighting can help) in your cover letter.&nbsp;</p><p>Start by looking at the following job description for a fictional higher education job.</p></div>

                <p>Dear Ms. Riley:</p>
                <p>Your &ldquo;This is Illinois Tech&rdquo; YouTube video is a powerful recruitment tool. Between that video, your impressive viewbook, the Fast Forward program, and the finance tools provided on your website, it is clear you have a lot to offer potential Illinois Tech applicants. I would be honored and excited to use these resources as your new Senior Admissions Counselor, committed to recruiting innovative and entrepreneurial thinkers to your programs.</p>
                <p><span style="background-color:pink">Your job description states that you are seeking an excellent communicator with extraordinary customer service skills.</span> As an admissions graduate assistant for Northwestern University and in my previous positions, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">I have demonstrated an ability to connect well with individuals and large groups alike.</span> <span style="background-color:pink">My presentations, written materials, and strategic programming have contributed to a 200% increase in mentor applications at DePaul and 11% increase in membership growth at Rotary International.</span> <span style="background-color:orange">Additionally, my team spirit and relationship-building skills have led my superiors and colleagues to select me for promotions and special projects.</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">This track record for success will help me to represent and market Illinois Tech effectively and to support the enrollment goals of your institution.</span><p>
                <p>If selected for this position, I will use my critical thinking, analytical, and technical skills as I counsel prospective students and their families through the admission process. <span style="background-color:orange">Having learned Northwestern&rsquo;s recruitment software very quickly, I&rsquo;m confident that I can do the same with yours, updating your databases and running reports that will aid admission decisions and improve operations.</span> <span style="background-color:lightblue">Not only have I demonstrated my abilities in this area through evaluation of up to 75 Northwestern applications per week,</span> I honed my research skills through my recent master&rsquo;s project, too. My findings about a student&rsquo;s first-year experience at an institution will inform and improve my ability to assess &ldquo;fit&rdquo; between an applicant and Illinois Tech.</p><p>While I&rsquo;ve tried to address the requirements stated in the Senior Admissions Counselor job description, I know there is more to learn. Would you have a few moments to meet in person, please, so that we can talk in detail about your needs for this position? &nbsp;Thank you very much for your consideration of my application. I look forward to hearing from you!<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ariselda Johnson</p></div>

</h3>
                        <p>In this case, it is appropriate to use the first and last name (i.e., “Dear Pat Ward:” instead of “Dear Ms. Ward:”). Please avoid using “To Whom It May Concern” whenever possible. It is infinitely better to address your cover letter to a real person, even when you are applying via an online job bank. </p>
                        <h3>What if I don’t know the name of the hiring manager?
</h3>
                        <p>Sleuth out the name by researching the institution website, asking your contacts, or simply calling the department. Say that you are applying for the open position and that you would like to address the cover letter to the right person.

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <h3>What do I include in my first paragraph?</h3>
                        <p>Your opening paragraph woos employers, capturing their attention and ensuring that you are writing directly to them and not just changing the name of the institution on a generic letter. If you are short on time and can only tailor one paragraph, this should be your focus.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…express enthusiasm for the position, and share how you heard about it. (If you were referred to the position by someone the hiring manager trusts, this can win you points.) </li>
                            <li>…state what you admire about the department, based on what you’ve learned from contacts or your research of their website and social media.</li>
                            <li>…demonstrate your interest in and/or knowledge of the department and institution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Don't</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…start with, “My name is…,” as this can label you as inexperienced in an employer’s mind.</li>
                            <li>…talk about what the role could do for you (i.e., “This position would be an excellent opportunity for me to….”) This does not distinguish you from the masses and wastes valuable cover letter real estate.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="info-menu letter-three"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a>
                        <h2>Body</h2>
                        <h3>What do I include in the body of the letter?</h3>
                        <p>The second and third paragraphs connect your experience to the needs of the position. Ideally, this is more than just a reiteration of your resume. It is your chance to prove you are qualified and to spell out the connections between your past experience and the job’s requirements.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…highlight achievements. Employers want to know not just what you’ve done, but how well you’ve done it.</li>
                            <li>…feel free to borrow from the language of the job description when articulating what goals you’re prepared to accomplish for an employer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Don't</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…apologize for or even mention any qualifications you’re lacking. Focus on the positive!</li>
                            <li>…make empty claims (e.g., I feel I’m the best candidate for the position.) Instead, prove your qualifications (e.g., In analyzing survey data and preparing a report used for my department’s program review, I demonstrated the strong research and communication skills you’re seeking.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>What if my relevant experience is with employers outside higher ed?</h3>
                        <p>A cover letter is the perfect medium for conveying transferable skills you acquired outside higher ed. Focus on what you did rather than for whom you did it. A simple strategy for this is to omit the details and jargon that wouldn’t be relevant and to speak in language that resonates with your employer. If you’re unsure of how to do this, take the time to meet with the MSHE Career Coach, conduct some informational interviews, or review job descriptions of interest to discover popular terminology for the positions attractive to you.</p>
                     </div>

                    <div class="info-menu letter-four"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a>
                        <h2>Closing</h2>
                        <h3>How do I end well?</h3>
                        <p>In good news for time-strapped MSHE students, the closing paragraph can be largely the same for most cover letters. In it, you’ll want to request a next step (e.g., an interview), state how you can be reached, and express your gratitude for the consideration of your application. This last step is important; don’t forget to say, “Thank you!” </p>
