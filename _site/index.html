                <h1>Resume and Cover Letter Workshops</h1>
                
                <p>Your resume and cover letter are the marketing documents you’ll need for a successful job search. Together, they tell your professional story – the goals you want to help an employer achieve, and the skills, experience, and values you possess that will help you do so.</p>
                <p>As you craft your cover letters and resume, please keep the following, general tips in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The resume and cover letter must be complementary, but each must also be strong enough to stand on its own.</strong> you never know which documentrecruiters and hiring managers will scan first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cover letters are not optional. </strong>They are essential, even if they are not requested.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sitting at your computer at midnight submitting application after application is not a good job search strategy.</strong> A good rule of thumb is to spend at least as much time networking as you do submitting applications. Many would argue you should spend more. </li>
                    <li><strong>Asking for help is not a weakness.</strong> If you have questions about how to design your job search strategy, please contact Audra Nelson, Kristin McCann, or Lois Trautvetter. We’re here to help!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With that said, please take advantage of these training tools to help you craft cover letters and a resume that will instill you with pride, impress employers, and generate interviews. We hope you find this training beneficial! If it is (and especially if it isn’t), please provide feedback to audra.nelson@northwestern.edu.</p>

            <h4>Creating a Strong Higher Ed Resume</h4>
            <p>Resumes are marketing documents, which means that, to be effective, they need to resonate with your desired audience. To find out what will speak to your target higher education employer, review job descriptions in your area of career interest prior to writing your resume.</p><p><strong>Activity: Keep an Ongoing, Comprehensive Resume<br />When to start: Upon enrolling in the MSHE program</strong></p><p>You probably wrote a resume when you applied to the MSHE program. Don&rsquo;t delete it! A comprehensive, all-encompassing resume is a great thing to have on hand.</p><ol><li>As you complete class projects, internships, and job projects, add them to your comprehensive resume.</li><li>Do a search on higheredjobs.com, and identify a few jobs of interest to you. Scan the requirements and the verbs used in the job descriptions.</li><li>How many of the requirements and verbs in your desired job descriptions are incorporated into your resume? Are there skills you need to grow during your time as a graduate student in order to make yourself more competitive for these positions? Now is the time to do so!</li></ol><p><strong>Activity: Write a <i>Targeted</i> Resume<br />When to start: When you begin actively searching for a job (i.e. three to six months prior to graduation)</strong></p><p>While the comprehensive resume is good to keep in your files, the resume you distribute should be targeted to your specific career goal. This activity will help you write a more targeted resume.</p><ol><li>Do a search on higheredjobs.com, and identify a few jobs of interest to you.</li><li>Highlight action verbs used in the position description and in the required and preferred qualifications.</li><li>Circle any repeated verbs.</li><li>Make a list of field-specific terminology or jargon included in the description.</li><li>Now, take a look at your resume. Have you used the verbs you highlighted and circled in your lists of duties and achievements? If not, how can you re-write the bullets to incorporate these skills?</li><li>What details have you included in your resume that now seem extraneous or distracting, given the requirements and needs of the positions you&rsquo;re seeking? Remember that an employer may spend only 30 seconds to a minute scanning your resume. Make sure all the details you include are either relevant to his/her needs and the requirements of the position or important for conveying your unique qualities as a person and professional.</li></ol><div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div><h4>Sample Resume</h4><p>Explore the sample resume below and think critically about what makes this resume good or bad. You can take a look at helpful tips, advice, and critiques by clicking on the <span style="color:aqua;">blue dots</span> throughout the resume sample.

                    <h2>Begin Well</h2>
                    <h3>Should I include my physical address on my resume?</h3>
                    <p>It depends. A physical address can benefit you, especially if you live in the city in which you’re job searching, by sparking fewer questions/reservations in an employer’s mind. If you’re worried about security and you’re posting your resume to online job boards, though, a physical address isn’t always necessary anymore. If you choose not to list your address, be sure to include your telephone number, email address, and perhaps a LinkedIn URL.</p>
                    <h3>What else can be listed in the heading?</h3>
                    <p>Some applicants list their MBTI type or their five StrengthsQuest strengths. These are particularly relevant if you’re applying to positions within student affairs and you know, based on networking or informational interviews, that this information is important to your potential employer. Otherwise, it is fine to stick with just the basic contact information.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Education: Publicizing Your Degrees</h2>
                    <h3>Which should I list first - education or experience?</h3>
                    <p>Unless you are a career advancer with several years of relevant experience, andyour MSHE degree is simply an added bonus, “Education” should probably be the first section of your resume. You’ve invested time and money in this degree; it’s important to market it!</p>
                    <h3>How should I write MSHE?</h3>
                    <p>Write out the full name and include the university, city, and state. Also include your graduation month and year even if it is anticipated graduation for the future. For example:</p>
                    <blockquote><strong>Northwestern University</strong> | Evanston, IL<br />Master of Science in Higher Education Administration &amp; Policy, Graduation Month Year</blockquote>
                    <h3>Should I include anything else?</h3>
                    <p>Master&rsquo;s Project: Title or, if title isn&rsquo;t relevant to job target, use a description of the project, written with your desired audience in mind</p>
                    <p>Relevant courses: List only if particularly relevant to target position and only if you&rsquo;re willing to talk about them in an interview</p>
                    <p>GPA: Typically, GPA is unnecessary at this point in your career. If you choose to include it, do so for both undergrad and grad school so that you don’t raise a question in the employer’s mind by including it in only one place.</p>
                    <p>Honors: Feel free to list honors. If you list cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, these Latin words should be in lowercase and italicized.</p>

                    <h2>Experience: Telling the Story of What you <i>Want</i> to Do</h2>
                    <h3>How do I know which jobs to include, and how do I organize them?</h3>
                    <p>Include employment since your undergraduate graduation or the last 10 years – whichever is shorter.</p>
                    <p>Typically, recruiters like to see positions listed in reverse chronological order. To ensure that all your relevant experiences are seen first, you may choose to group experiences under two headings – Higher Education Experience and Additional Experience. If you have enough experience in your targeted career area, you can make your heading even more specific (e.g., Career Services Experience, International Education Experience, or Enrollment Management Experience may precede Additional Experience).</p>

                    <h2>Bulleted Descriptions: Proving Your Abilities and Achievements</h2>
                    <h3>How do I write compelling bullet points?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with powerful, action verbs. Avoid repetition and phrases like, “Responsible for…”</li>
                        <li>Quantify your work whenever possible.</li>
                        <li>Include the impact and/or results of your work. Bullets written as accomplishments, rather than duties, pack a bigger punch.</li>
                        <li>Prioritize bullets not according to how much time you spent on a particular task or the order of importance to your current job, but according to each bullet&rsquo;s relevance to your desired position.</li>
                        <li>Omit any tasks (e.g., answered phone, input data) that you do not want to do in the future or that brand you as a lower-level employee if you are applying for an upper-level position.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p class="editable">Cover letters are a way to stand out from the pile. Hiring managers expect to see specific experience in your cover letter related to the job description. For example, you might want to start by going through a job description and looking for the key areas you can highlight (literally highlighting can help) in your cover letter.&nbsp;</p>

    <h4 class="editable">Think like a hiring manager</h4>
        <p class="editable">Evaluating someone else’s resume can help you glean insights that aren’t as obvious when critiquing your own materials. Several MSHE Alumni have graciously agreed to provide their cover letters and resumes to jobs for which they have been interested. Take a look at the application materials below alongside the provided actual job descriptions. If you were the hiring manager, would you invite them for an interview? What would you be curious about? How would your resume/cover letter stack up?</p>
