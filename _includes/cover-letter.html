            <h4 class="editable">Tailor a cover letter to the job</h4>
            <div class="editable"><p>Cover letters are a way to stand out from the pile. A writing sample and marketing tool, the cover letter shows that you understand the needs of the open position and convinces an employer you can fulfill those needs with your particular skill set and experience.</p><p>Cover letters should be three to five paragraphs in length and no longer than one page. Be sure to use a business letter format, as indicated in the sample, and know that the more you can tailor letters to each specific position for which you apply, the better.</p><p>Hiring managers expect to see specific experience in your cover letter related to the job description. To accomplish this, you might want to start by going through a job description and looking for the key areas you can highlight (literally highlighting can help) in your cover letter.&nbsp;</p><p>Start by looking at the following job description for a fictional higher education job.</p></div>

                <p>Dear Ms. Riley:</p>
                <p>Your &ldquo;This is Illinois Tech&rdquo; YouTube video is a powerful recruitment tool. Between that video, your impressive viewbook, the Fast Forward program, and the finance tools provided on your website, it is clear you have a lot to offer potential Illinois Tech applicants. I would be honored and excited to use these resources as your new Senior Admissions Counselor, committed to recruiting innovative and entrepreneurial thinkers to your programs.</p>
                <p><span style="background-color:pink">Your job description states that you are seeking an excellent communicator with extraordinary customer service skills.</span> As an admissions graduate assistant for Northwestern University and in my previous positions, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">I have demonstrated an ability to connect well with individuals and large groups alike.</span> <span style="background-color:pink">My presentations, written materials, and strategic programming have contributed to a 200% increase in mentor applications at DePaul and 11% increase in membership growth at Rotary International.</span> <span style="background-color:orange">Additionally, my team spirit and relationship-building skills have led my superiors and colleagues to select me for promotions and special projects.</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">This track record for success will help me to represent and market Illinois Tech effectively and to support the enrollment goals of your institution.</span><p>
                <p>If selected for this position, I will use my critical thinking, analytical, and technical skills as I counsel prospective students and their families through the admission process. <span style="background-color:orange">Having learned Northwestern&rsquo;s recruitment software very quickly, I&rsquo;m confident that I can do the same with yours, updating your databases and running reports that will aid admission decisions and improve operations.</span> <span style="background-color:lightblue">Not only have I demonstrated my abilities in this area through evaluation of up to 75 Northwestern applications per week,</span> I honed my research skills through my recent master&rsquo;s project, too. My findings about a student&rsquo;s first-year experience at an institution will inform and improve my ability to assess &ldquo;fit&rdquo; between an applicant and Illinois Tech.</p><p>While I&rsquo;ve tried to address the requirements stated in the Senior Admissions Counselor job description, I know there is more to learn. Would you have a few moments to meet in person, please, so that we can talk in detail about your needs for this position? &nbsp;Thank you very much for your consideration of my application. I look forward to hearing from you!<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ariselda Johnson</p></div>

                        <h3>What if I don’t know the gender of the recipient? 
</h3>
                        <p>In this case, it is appropriate to use the first and last name (i.e., “Dear Pat Ward:” instead of “Dear Ms. Ward:”). Please avoid using “To Whom It May Concern” whenever possible. It is infinitely better to address your cover letter to a real person, even when you are applying via an online job bank. </p>
                        <h3>What if I don’t know the name of the hiring manager?
</h3>
                        <p>Sleuth out the name by researching the institution website, asking your contacts, or simply calling the department. Say that you are applying for the open position and that you would like to address the cover letter to the right person. You will be showing initiative and may even increase your chances of getting an interview!</p>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <h3>What do I include in my first paragraph?</h3>
                        <p>Your opening paragraph woos employers, capturing their attention and ensuring that you are writing directly to them and not just changing the name of the institution on a generic letter. If you are short on time and can only tailor one paragraph, this should be your focus.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…express enthusiasm for the position, and share how you heard about it. (If you were referred to the position by someone the hiring manager trusts, this can win you points.) </li>
                            <li>…state what you admire about the department, based on what you’ve learned from contacts or your research of their website and social media.</li>
                            <li>…demonstrate your interest in and/or knowledge of the department and institution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Don't</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…start with, “My name is…,” as this can label you as inexperienced in an employer’s mind.</li>
                            <li>…talk about what the role could do for you (i.e., “This position would be an excellent opportunity for me to….”) This does not distinguish you from the masses and wastes valuable cover letter real estate.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                </div>
                <div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o letter-three"></i>
                    <div class="info-menu letter-three"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a>
                        <h2>Body</h2>
                        <h3>What do I include in the body of the letter?</h3>
                        <p>The second and third paragraphs connect your experience to the needs of the position. Ideally, this is more than just a reiteration of your resume. It is your chance to prove you are qualified and to spell out the connections between your past experience and the job’s requirements.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…highlight achievements. Employers want to know not just what you’ve done, but how well you’ve done it.</li>
                            <li>…feel free to borrow from the language of the job description when articulating what goals you’re prepared to accomplish for an employer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Don't</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>…apologize for or even mention any qualifications you’re lacking. Focus on the positive!</li>
                            <li>…make empty claims (e.g., I feel I’m the best candidate for the position.) Instead, prove your qualifications (e.g., In analyzing survey data and preparing a report used for my department’s program review, I demonstrated the strong research and communication skills you’re seeking.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>What if my relevant experience is with employers outside higher ed?</h3>
                        <p>A cover letter is the perfect medium for conveying transferable skills you acquired outside higher ed. Focus on what you did rather than for whom you did it. A simple strategy for this is to omit the details and jargon that wouldn’t be relevant and to speak in language that resonates with your employer. If you’re unsure of how to do this, take the time to meet with the MSHE Career Coach, conduct some informational interviews, or review job descriptions of interest to discover popular terminology for the positions attractive to you.</p>
                     </div>
                </div>
                <div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o letter-four"></i>
                    <div class="info-menu letter-four"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a>
                        <h2>Closing</h2>
                        <h3>How do I end well?</h3>
                        <p>In good news for time-strapped MSHE students, the closing paragraph can be largely the same for most cover letters. In it, you’ll want to request a next step (e.g., an interview), state how you can be reached, and express your gratitude for the consideration of your application. This last step is important; don’t forget to say, “Thank you!” </p>
