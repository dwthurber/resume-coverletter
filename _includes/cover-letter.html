Between that video, your impressive viewbook, the Fast Forward program, and the finance tools provided on your website, it is clear you have a lot to offer potential Illinois Tech applicants. I would be honored and excited to use these resources as your new Senior Admissions Counselor, committed to recruiting innovative and entrepreneurial thinkers to your programs.</p><p>Your job description states that you are seeking an excellent communicator with extraordinary customer service skills. As an admissions graduate assistant for Northwestern University and in my previous positions, I have demonstrated an ability to connect well with individuals and large groups alike. My presentations, written materials, and strategic programming have contributed to a 200% increase in mentor applications at DePaul and 11% increase in membership growth at Rotary International. Additionally, my team spirit and relationship-building skills have led my superiors and colleagues to select me for promotions and special projects. This track record for success will help me to represent and market Illinois Tech effectively and to support the enrollment goals of your institution.</p><p>If selected for this position, I will use my critical thinking, analytical, and technical skills as I counsel prospective students and their families through the admission process. Having learned Northwestern&rsquo;s recruitment software very quickly, I&rsquo;m confident that I can do the same with yours, updating your databases and running reports that will aid admission decisions and improve operations. Not only have I demonstrated my abilities in this area through evaluation of up to 75 Northwestern applications per week, I honed my research skills through my recent master&rsquo;s project, too. My findings about a student&rsquo;s first-year experience at an institution will inform and improve my ability to assess &ldquo;fit&rdquo; between an applicant and Illinois Tech.</p><p>While I&rsquo;ve tried to address the requirements stated in the Senior Admissions Counselor job description, I know there is more to learn. Would you have a few moments to meet in person, please, so that we can talk in detail about your needs for this position? &nbsp;Thank you very much for your consideration of my application. I look forward to hearing from you!<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ariselda Johnson</p></div>
