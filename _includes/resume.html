        <div class="container editable"><h4>Creating a Strong Higher Ed Resume</h4><p>Resumes are marketing documents, which means that, to be effective, they need to resonate with your desired audience. To find out what will speak to your target higher education employer, review job descriptions in your area of career interest prior to writing your resume.</p><p><strong>Activity: Keep an Ongoing, Comprehensive Resume<br />When to start: Upon enrolling in the MSHE program</strong></p><p>You probably wrote a resume when you applied to the MSHE program. Don&rsquo;t delete it! A comprehensive, all-encompassing resume is a great thing to have on hand.</p><ol><li>As you complete class projects, internships, and job projects, add them to your comprehensive resume.</li><li>Do a search on higheredjobs.com, and identify a few jobs of interest to you. Scan the requirements and the verbs used in the job descriptions.</li><li>How many of the requirements and verbs in your desired job descriptions are incorporated into your resume? Are there skills you need to grow during your time as a graduate student in order to make yourself more competitive for these positions? Now is the time to do so!</li></ol><p><strong>Activity: Write a <i>Targeted</i> Resume<br />When to start: When you begin actively searching for a job (i.e. three to six months prior to graduation)</strong></p><p>While the comprehensive resume is good to keep in your files, the resume you distribute should be targeted to your specific career goal. This activity will help you write a more targeted resume.</p><ol><li>Do a search on higheredjobs.com, and identify a few jobs of interest to you.</li><li>Highlight action verbs used in the position description and in the required and preferred qualifications.</li><li>Circle any repeated verbs.</li><li>Make a list of field-specific terminology or jargon included in the description.</li><li>Now, take a look at your resume. Have you used the verbs you highlighted and circled in your lists of duties and achievements? If not, how can you re-write the bullets to incorporate these skills?</li><li>What details have you included in your resume that now seem extraneous or distracting, given the requirements and needs of the positions you&rsquo;re seeking? Remember that an employer may spend only 30 seconds to a minute scanning your resume. Make sure all the details you include are either relevant to his/her needs and the requirements of the position or important for conveying your unique qualities as a person and professional.</li></ol><div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div><h4>Sample Resume</h4><p>Explore the sample resume below and think critically about what makes this resume good or bad.

A physical address can benefit you, especially if you live in the city in which you&rsquo;re job searching, by sparking fewer questions/reservations in an employer&rsquo;s mind. If you&rsquo;re worried about security and you&rsquo;re posting your resume to online job boards, though, a physical address isn&rsquo;t always necessary anymore. If you choose not to list your address, be sure to include your telephone number, email address, and perhaps a LinkedIn URL.</p><h3>What else can be listed in the heading?</h3><p>Some applicants list their MBTI type or their five StrengthsQuest strengths. These are particularly relevant if you&rsquo;re applying to positions within student affairs and you know, based on networking or informational interviews, that this information is important to your potential employer. Otherwise, it is fine to stick with just the basic contact information.</p></div></div><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o resume-two"></i><div class="info-menu resume-two"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a><h2>Education: Publicizing Your Degrees</h2><h3>Which should I list first - education or experience?</h3><p>Unless you are a career advancer with several years of relevant experience, andyour MSHE degree is simply an added bonus, &ldquo;Education&rdquo; should probably be the first section of your resume. You&rsquo;ve invested time and money in this degree; it&rsquo;s important to market it!</p><h3>How should I write MSHE?</h3><p>Write out the full name and include the university, city, and state. Also include your graduation month and year even if it is anticipated graduation for the future. For example:</p><blockquote><strong>Northwestern University</strong> | Evanston, IL<br />Master of Science in Higher Education Administration &amp; Policy, Graduation Month Year</blockquote><h3>Should I include anything else?</h3><p>Master&rsquo;s Project: Title or, if title isn&rsquo;t relevant to job target, use a description of the project, written with your desired audience in mind</p><p>Relevant courses: List only if particularly relevant to target position and only if you&rsquo;re willing to talk about them in an interview</p><p>GPA: Typically, GPA is unnecessary at this point in your career. If you choose to include it, do so for both undergrad and grad school so that you don&rsquo;t raise a question in the employer&rsquo;s mind by including it in only one place.</p><p>Honors: Feel free to list honors. If you list cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, these Latin words should be in lowercase and italicized.</p></div></div><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o resume-three"></i><div class="info-menu resume-three"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a><h2>Experience: Telling the Story of What you <i>Want</i> to Do</h2><h3>How do I know which jobs to include, and how do I organize them?</h3><p>Include employment since your undergraduate graduation or the last 10 years &ndash; whichever is shorter.</p><p>Typically, recruiters like to see positions listed in reverse chronological order. To ensure that all your relevant experiences are seen first, you may choose to group experiences under two headings &ndash; Higher Education Experience and Additional Experience. If you have enough experience in your targeted career area, you can make your heading even more specific (e.g., Career Services Experience, International Education Experience, or Enrollment Management Experience may precede Additional Experience).</p></div></div><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o resume-four"></i><div class="info-menu resume-four"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a><h2>Bulleted Descriptions: Proving Your Abilities and Achievements</h2><h3>How do I write compelling bullet points?</h3><ul><li>Start with powerful, action verbs.

This is a great section to include if you have done research of which you are particularly proud and/or if you&rsquo;re applying to research-oriented positions. It&rsquo;s not, however, a necessary section of a resume. Be careful about including a long list of research and presentations, in fact, as that might make employers think you were hoping to go the academic, as opposed to administrative, route.</p></div></div></div><div class="resume hidden" id="resume-two">&nbsp;<br><div class="left"><p><strong>Ariselda Johnson</strong> | ariseldajohnson@u.northwestern.edu</p></div><div class="right"><p>page 2</p></div><hr /><h2>Additional Experience</h2><p><strong>Rotary Internation</strong> | Evanston, IL<br /><em>Regional Membership Assistant Director</em>, November 2012 &ndash; June 2015</p><ul><li>Helped develop and implement member attraction and engagement strategies among volunteer-led clubs throughout the Midwest</li><li>Supported regional club growth of 11% during tenure</li><li>Communicated key resources to volunteers through email newsletters, social media, and in-person information sessions, enabling volunteers to work more efficiently and effectively</li><li>Averaged 200+ direct contacts (face-to-face, telephone, and email) per month<br />&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Best Practice Merchandising</strong> | Indianapolis, IN<br /><em>Research Associate</em>, August 2011 &ndash; October 2012</p><ul><li>Researched and analyzed marketing data and made strategic recommendations that contributed to a 5% increase in client&rsquo;s annual sales</li><li>Collaborated with three-member internal marketing team to generate monthly newsletter and plan quarterly social events; improved 50-person staff morale<br />&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Pete Miller's</strong> | Evanston, IL<br /><em>Lead Hostess</em>, Summer 2011; Hostess, Summer 2010</p><ul><li>Selected as lead weekend hostess after one summer of exemplary performance</li><li>Served as first point of contact, establishing rapport and welcoming customers into the restaurant</li><li>Managed reservation system and mediated conflicts for groups of two to 50-person parties</li><li>Collaborated with the kitchen and serving staff teams to ensure efficient and excellent service</li><li>Maintained tact, diplomacy, and friendliness in a fast-paced environment</li></ul><h2>Professional Associations &amp; Community Involvement</h2><p><strong>National Association for College Admissions Counseling (NACAC)</strong><br /><strong></strong><em>Conference Volunteer</em>, Spring 2016</p><p><strong>Northwestern University Sidekicks (Peer mentoring program for international graduate students)</strong><br /><strong></strong><em>Mentor</em>, August 2015 - June 2016</p><p><strong>Salvation Army</strong><br /><i>Special Distribution Manager</i>, 2015<br /><em>Food Pantry Assistant</em>, August 2013 - May 2015</p><p><strong>Chicago Sketch Comedy Festival</strong><br /><em>Volunteer Scheduling Manager</em>, 2014<br /><em>Festival Volunteer</em>, 2013 - 2014</p><h2>Skills and Interests</h2><ul><li><strong>Language:&nbsp;</strong>Fluent in Spanish</li><li><strong>Computer: </strong>Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook; Prezi; Social Media: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, YellowDig</li><li><strong>Interests:</strong> Sketch Comedy, Volunteering, and marathon-running</li></ul><div class="info"><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o resume-six"></i><div class="info-menu resume-six"><a href="#/"><i class="fa fa-times-circle info-close"></i></a><h2>Additional Experience: Articulating the Relevance</h2><h3>How do I include experience that is unrelated to my job target?</h3><p>You have a couple different options.
