    <div class="container editable"><h4>Always have someone else look at your resume and cover letter</h4><p>Proofreading is paramount to success in a job search. Having another set of eyes checking for spelling and grammar mistakes can be the difference between a rejection letter and an interview offer, so seeking advice on these materials is an important step that should never be skipped.</p><p>If you would like Audra Nelson, MSHE Career Coach, to provide feedback on your resume and/or cover letter, please email her at <a href="mailto:audra.nelson@northwestern.edu">audra.nelson@northwestern.edu</a>. She can help connect you with alumni or other professionals in your career areas of interest in order to request their insights on your materials, as well.&nbsp;</p>
